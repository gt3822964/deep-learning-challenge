# deep-learning-challenge

We made a computer model to guess if Alphabet Soup's money-raising would work well. We tried three ways using advanced computer learning. First, we fixed our data and split it into parts for the computer to learn and test. We made sure the computer knew what to predict, like how much money was raised.

Outcomes:

First model: Best one, used Adam method, trained 100 times, had two parts in it, and got 72.57% right.
Second model: Close to first, used RMSprop, trained 100 times, more parts, 72.52% right.
Third model: Not good, used Nadam, trained 50 times, only 48.33% right.
Summary: First and second models did well, but the third didn't.

Advice: Trying a new way like CNNs might work better, especially for certain types of data. Also, different methods or learned knowledge from other tasks could improve results.
